Details:
-The file "exploration.py" has the final simulation code used for obtaining the videos in the folder Simulation_videos.
-To obtain the different three different maps have been used namely "map.png" , "map2.png", "map3.png".
-To change the map, change the statement, "map = pygame.image.load('map.png')" to the desired map in exploration.py
- Also the initial position of the car should be changed according to the map in car.py
- The 2D Lidar simulation has been done in car.py. The parameters (N,d,phi) for the Lidar should be changed there if necessary.
- A variable K_theta has been used which specifies the sensitivity of omega on the readings obtained by the Lidar. I can be modified according to the environment.
- Along with the codes an image called "car.png" has been added which specifes the image of car imported in "car.py"
